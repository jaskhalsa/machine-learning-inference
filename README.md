# machine-learning-inference
Contains the work for the second part of the coursework.

This coursework focused on the ising model to remove noise to produce the latent image.
It includes three different methods in doing so:
- Iterative conditional modes
- Gibbs sampling
- Variational Bayes

The final part was to perform some image segmentation. Gibbs sampling was used here also.
